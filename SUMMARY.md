- Encryption: The code compares the username and password directly without any encryption. Storing passwords in plain text can lead to security vulnerabilities. Use an appropriate encryption mechanism to securely store and compare passwords.Instead of hard-coding the username and password information in the code, it would be more appropriate to store user information in a database.

- At ApiAuthenticationEntryPoint >>>> Instead of manually closing the response writer using writer.close(), you can use try-with-resources to automatically close the writer after writing the response. This ensures proper resource handling
